Jimin
My blood, sweat, and tears
My last dance
Take it all

My blood, sweat, and tears
My cold breath
Take it all
Jimin
My blood, sweat, and tears
Suga
My blood, sweat, and tears
My body, mind, and soul
Know well that I am yours
This is a spell that will punish me
RM
Peaches and cream
Sweeter than sweet
Chocolate cheeks
And chocolate wings
But your wings are the devil's
Before your sweetness there is bitter, bitter
JHope
Kiss me, it doesn't matter
If it hurts, make it tighter
So that can't even hurt anymore
Baby, it's okay to get drunk
Now I drink you
Deep into my throat
The whiskey that is you
V
My blood, sweat, and tears
My last dance

My cold breath
Take it all

//I want you a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot
I want you a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot//
//I want you a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot
I want you a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot//
JHope
It doesn't matter if it hurts
Make it tighter so I can't escape
Hold me tight and shake me
So I'll be unconscious
Suga
Kiss me on the lip, lips
This is a secret between the two of us
I am addicted to the prison that is you
I cannot worship
Anyone else besides you
I knowingly drank from the poisoned chalice
Jimin
My blood, sweat, an tears
My last dance
Take it all

My cold breath

JHope
//I want you a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot
I want you a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot//
//I want you a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot
I want you a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot//

Kill me softly
Jungkook
Close my eyes with your caress
Jin
Jimin
I can't reject it anyways
I can't even escape anymore
You are too sweet, too sweet
Because you are too sweet
