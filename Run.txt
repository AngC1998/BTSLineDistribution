RM
You are my only sun, one and only in the world
I bloomed for you, but I’m still getting thirsty
It’s too late, too late, I can’t live without you
Though my branch runs dry, I reach for you with all my strength
Suga
No matter how far I reach for you,
Suga
RM
It is just an empty dream dream dream
Suga
No matter how crazy I run,
Suga
RM
I remain on the same place place place
Suga
Just burn me! Yes, push me out!
This is crazy-fool’s love running
V
Let me run more
Please let me run more
Even though my feet are full of scars
I smile whenever I see you
Jungkook
Let’s run run run again! I can’t stop running
Let’s run run run again! I can’t help running
Jimin
Only thing I can do is run
Only thing I can do is love you
Jungkook
Let’s run run run again! It’s ok to fall down
Let’s run run run again! It’s ok to be injured
Jimin
I am happy enough even though I can’t get you
Curse me, this foolish destiny!

Don’t tell me bye bye
JHope
Everybody say it is over but I can’t stop this
I can’t tell whether it is sweat or tears
My bare-love and tough typhoon and wind
Can only make me run more with my heart
Jin
Let me run more

V
Memories are crumbling like
dried flower leaves
Jungkook
On my fingertips and under my feet
And behind my back
Jin
Like chasing butterfly or wondering in dreams
I follow your traces
Jungkook
Please guide me please stop me
Jungkook
Jimin
Please let me breathe
