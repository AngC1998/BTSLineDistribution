Open your eyes under the sour blue sky
The pouring sun makes me dizzy
Jimin
Out of breath
I can feel it
RM
It's okay
Even though my grief is gone
With a black cloud
Even if I lie in endless dreams
Crumpled to the limit
The wings are torn
Even if I'm not myself someday
It's okay
I'm the only one who can save me
He walks badly and never dies
How about you?
My sky is clear
All the pain
Take care
Jungkook
My cold heart
I forgot how to call you
It's okay not to be lonely
Jin
The dark night
You shake in a sleeping dream
It's okay not to be afraid
Jungkook
I'm feeling just fine, fine
I'll let go of your hand now
I know I'm all mine, mine, mine
Cuz I'm just fine
Jimin
I'm feeling just fine, fine
I don't want to be sad anymore
I want to see the sunshine, shine, shine
Cuz I'm just fine, just fine
JHope
I'm just fine
I can get through this without you
Don't worry about I'm just fine
Now I can laugh
I know your voice
Suga
I'm so fine, you so fine
All sorrows and wounds
Now that they've past
Smile and send it to me
I'm so fine, you so fine
Our future is not just about joy
I'm gonna be complete
Thank you
Jimin
My cold heart
I forgot how to call you
It's okay not to be lonely
Jungkook
The dark night
You shake a sleeping dream
It's okay not to be afraid
V
I'm feeling just fine, fine
I'll let go of your hand now
I know I'm all mine, mine, mine
Cuz I'm just fine
Jin
I'm picking just fine, fine
I don't want to be sad anymore
I want to see the sunshine, shine, shine
Cuz I'm just fine, just fine
Jungkook
By any chance
Can I see you?
V
This thin moonlight
Jimin
Can I hear you?
Jin
This faint echo
Jungkook
I'm feeling just fine, fine
I'm just gonna scream
At this recurring nightmare
On the order
Jimin
I'm feeling just fine, fine
I'm gonna have to remind you a few times
And if he falls again
I'm alright
Jin
I'm feeling just fine, fine
I'm just gonna scream
At this recurring nightmare
On the order
V
I'm feeling just fine, fine
I'm gonna have to remind you a few times
And if he falls again
I'm alright
V
I'm fine
I'm fine
