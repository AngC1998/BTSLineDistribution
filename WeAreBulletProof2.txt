Jungkook
The name is Jung Kook, my scale is nationwide
I pulled all-nighters at practice rooms
instead of school, dancing and singing
When you guys partied,
I gave up sleep for my dreams
Suga
I spent all night holding a pen,
closing my eyes only after the morning sun rises
My limit was broken in the
double standards and many oppositions
But I got lucky and was contacted by an agency
All you who are called rappers because you can’t sing,
the rapper title is an extravagance for you
V
Everywhere I go, everything I do
I will show you, as much as I sharpened my sword
To all the people who looked down on me
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh) hey shout it out
Jimin
Oh! Throw a stone at me if you’ve done as much as I did
We go hard, we have no fear

JHope
Look at my profile, there’s nothing there yet
Still a trainee and rapper man,
yeah I do know that’s nothing
I contemplated a lot but now I don’t need anything
You’re still an amateur,
I’m in the majors, hope you’ll rot like that
RM
Rap Monster, like my name,
I can eat up any kind of beat like a monster
I’m loyal to my name, guys come here, take a preview,
I put a twist to being an idol
Haha, hyungs who only had hip-hop pride
told me it’d be impossible but
Look carefully, I place a period after impossible
I’m possible, now are we all set, boy?
