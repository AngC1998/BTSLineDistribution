JHope
I don’t have biceps or pecs
I don’t have a super car like Batman
It was my dream to become a hero
But the only thing I can give you is Anpan
I dreamed of a hero like Superman
So I jumped around, bouncing to the sky
Wasn’t scared of getting my kneecaps scratched up
It was my innocent childhood imagination
Suga
I’m not a superhero
Don’t expect too much from me
I can be your hero
Will this get through to you?
I don’t know
But I have to do this, Mom
Who can it be if it’s not me?
You can call me say Anpan

Jungkook
Keep turning, turning, my Anpan
Keep ballin’ ballin’ still bulletproof
Open my eyes, I’m a hero but still in a maze
That young man, young man, young man
Jimin
Secretly only getting scars
But ballin’ ballin’ still bulletproof
It hurts, hero but place your fears behind

RM
Sometimes, everything is so scary
So many things that I love
Some people say I’m an old geezer now
That I have no right, that I should just do what I’ve been doing
But I still wanna be a hero
But I can only give you an Anpan
And tell you that you did a good job
But if you call me, I’ll fly over to you
So call me

Honestly
I’m afraid of falling
Of disappointing you
But still, even if I have to use all my strength
I will stay by your side
Jimin
Though I’ll fall again
Though I’ll make mistakes again
Though I’ll fall into a mud pit again
Trust me, because I’m a hero
Yeah yeah
