Jimin
I’m still standing here with my eyes closed
Lost between the deserts and oceans
I’m still wandering
Where should I go yeah
Jungkook
I didn’t know there were this many
Paths I can’t go and paths I can’t take
I never felt this way before
Am I becoming an adult?
V
This is too hard,
is this path right for me
Jin
I am confused
Never leave me alone
Jimin
I still believe even though it’s unbelievable
Jungkook
To lose your path
Is the way to find that path
Jungkook
Lost my way
Jimin
Constantly pushing without rest within the harsh rainstorms
Jungkook
Lost my way
V
Within a complicated world without an exit
Jungkook
Lost my way
Jimin
Lost my way
No matter how much I wander, I want to believe in my path
Jungkook
Lost my way
Jin
Found my way
V
Lost my way
Jimin
Found my way
Jin
I once saw an ant going somewhere
There is no way to find the path at once
Jimin
Constantly crashing and crawling forward
To find something to eat, roaming for days
Jungkook
You know
Jin
There is a reason for all this frustration
I believe that we’re on the right path
Jungkook
If we ever find it
We will return home at once just like an ant
V
This is too hard,
is this path right for me
Jin
I am so confused
Don’t you leave me alone
Jungkook
I still want to believe even though it’s unbelieveable
Jimin
To lose your path
Is the way to find that path
Jimin
Lost my way
Jungkook
Constantly pushing without rest within the harsh rainstorms
Jimin
Lost my way
Jin
Within a complicated world without an exit
Jimin
Lost my way
Jungkook
Lost my way
I wander, I want to believe in my path
V
So long
Goodbye to my hope with no promise
Jungkook
So long
Even if I’m slow I will walk with my own feet
Jimin
Because I know this path is mine to take
Jin
Even if I go back, I will reach this path eventually
Jungkook
I never I will never
I will never lose my dream
Jungkook
Lost my way
Jimin
Constantly pushing without rest within the harsh rainstorms
Jungkook
Lost my way
V
Within a complicated world without an exit
Jungkook
Lost my way
Jimin
Lost my way
I wander, I want to believe in my path
Jungkook
Lost my way
Jin
Found my way
V
Lost my way
Jimin
Found my way
