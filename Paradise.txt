Jungkook
Marathon, marathon
Life is long, go slow
42.195
At the end, there will be a paradise of your dreams
Jimin
But the real world
Is different from the promises
We need to run, we need to step on others
When the signal is hot
You don’t even have a destination
There’s no landscape
When you’re running out of breath
Jimin
Jungkook
You need to you need to
V
It’s alright to stop
You don’t need to run without knowing why
Jungkook
It’s alright to not have any dreams
If you have moments where you can feel happiness
Jin
It’s alright to stop
Don’t run without knowing where you’re going anymore
Jimin
It’s alright to not have any dreams
All of the air you breathe out is already paradise
RM
We dream from others (like a debt)
We learn that we must become great (like a light)
Your dream is actually baggage
If only the future is a dream
What’s the dream I had last night in bed?
It’s alright if your dreams are different
Buying a laptop next month
Or just eating and sleeping
Having a lot of money by not doing anything
What’s so great about dreams?
Just be who you want
We deserve a life
Whether it’s big or small, you’re just doing you
Jimin
But the real world
Is different from the promises
We need to run, we need to step on others
When the signal is hot
You don’t even have a destination
There’s no landscape
When you’re running out of breath
Jimin
Jungkook
You need to you need to
Jungkook
It’s alright to stop
You don’t need to run without knowing why
Jin
It’s alright to not have any dreams
If you have moments where you can feel happiness
V
It’s alright to stop
Don’t run without knowing where you’re going anymore
Jimin
It’s alright to not have any dreams
All of the air you breathe out is already paradise
Suga
I don’t have a dream
Sometimes, dreaming is scary
Just living like this
Just surviving is a small dream to me
Dreaming, holding onto that dream
Breathing, sometimes these things are hard
That guy did that, that girl did that
The world tells me as it bashes me
JHope
Yeah
The world has no right to bash you
What’s the law for dreams?
No one ever taught us
Because it’s a made-up dream, a tearful sleep talk
Wake up from your nightmare
Just smile for yourself, in that paradise
V
It’s alright to stop
Don’t run without knowing where you’re going anymore
Jimin
It’s alright to not have any dreams
All of the air you breathe out is already paradise
BTS
Stop runnin’ for nothin’ my friend
Now stop this foolish race
Stop runnin’ for nothin’ my friend
All of the air you breathe out is already paradise
BTS
Stop runnin’ for nothin’ my friend
You don’t need to have a dream that everyone else has
Stop runnin’ for nothin’ my friend
All of the words that make you who you are is paradise
