I miss you
When I say that, I miss you more
I’m looking at your photo
But I still miss you
Time is so cruel
I hate us
Now it’s hard to even see each other’s faces
It’s only winter here
Even in August, winter is here
My heart makes time run
Like a Snowpiercer left alone
I wanna hold your hand
And go to the other side of the earth
To end this winter
How much longing has to fall like snow
For the spring days to come?
Friend
Jimin
Like a small piece
Of dust
That floats in the air
V
If the flying snow is me
I could
Reach you faster
Jungkook
Snowflakes are falling
Getting farther away
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
V
How much more do I have to wait?
How many more nights do I have to stay up?
V
Jungkook
Until I can see you? (until I can see you?)
Until I can meet you? (until I can meet you?)
JHope
Jin
Past the end of this cold winter
Until the spring comes again
Until the flowers bloom again
Stay there a little longer
Stay there
Suga
Did you change?
Suga
Jimin
(Did you change?)
Suga
Or did I change?
Suga
Jimin
(Did I change?)
Suga
I hate even this moment that is passing
I guess we changed
I guess that’s how everything is
Suga
Yeah I hate you
Although you left
There hasn’t been a day that I have forgotten you
Honestly, I miss you
Suga
Jimin
But now I’ll erase you
Suga
Because that will hurt less than resenting you
Jin
I’m blowing out the cold you
Like smoke, like white smoke
Jimin
I say that I’m gonna erase you
But actually, I still can’t let you go
Jungkook
Snowflakes are falling
Getting farther away
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
V
How much more do I have to wait?
How many more nights do I have to stay up?
V
Jungkook
Until I can see you? (until I can see you?)
Until I can meet you? (until I can meet you?)
V
You know it all
You’re my best friend
The morning will come again
Jungkook
Because no darkness,
No season
Can last forever
Jimin
Cherry blossoms are blooming
The winter is ending
Jimin
Jungkook
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
Jungkook
V
If I wait a little longer (if I wait)
Jungkook
If I stay up a few more nights
Jungkook
V
Jimin
I’ll go see you (I’ll go see you)
I’ll go pick you up (I’ll go pick you up)
Jin
JHope
Past the end of this cold winter
Until the spring comes again
Until the flowers bloom again
Stay there a little longer
Jin
Stay there
