Could pretend like I was happy when I was sad
For you, I
Jungkook
Could pretend like I was strong when I was hurt
I wish love was perfect as love itself
I wish all my weaknesses could be hidden
I grew a flower that can’t be bloomed 
In a dream that can’t come true

I wanna be a good man just for you
I gave the world just for you
I changed everything just for you
But I dunno me, who are you?
JHope
The forest just for us, you weren’t there
The route I took, I forgot
I even became quite unsure of who I was
Try babbling into the mirror, who the heck are you?
