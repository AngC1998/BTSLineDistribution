If I could, I wanted to ask you
Why did you do that back then? Why did you kick me out?
Jungkook
Without a name, I’m still lingering around you
Our goodbye was colorless, without any change
RM
I have no name
Although I was your star
Must be nice to be a light
All I did was to receive you
In a destroyed castle
What good is it to have fame
I’ll receive it till I die
Your sweltering looks
I still revolve around you, nothing’s changed
But if there’s no name to love
Everything has changed
Did you really find the Eris?
Tell me, what does the moon have that I don’t?
Us is just a plural of U
Maybe I was never there from the start
Some day, you’ll understand
My season was always you
My cold heart was -248 degrees
The day you erased me, everything stopped
Damn
Jimin
I’m only going around
Jin
(I let go of you, I lost you)
Jimin
I’m just going in circles
Jin
(You erased me, you forgot me)
Jungkook
Once I was in a world under the sun
V
(The songs have stopped)
Jungkook
Only stale fog in this star’s heart
V
(You erased me, you forgot me)
Suga
Nothing much different from yesterday
Same old days, it’s just you’re not here
We were together just up until yesterday
But it’s to the point where it’s scary, same days but no you
I’ll be honest, even up until one year without you
I was just fine, I didn’t have any remaining feelings
I forgot about it all
Even your scent
But wait, this perfume smells familiar
Just when my memory was about to come back
I turned my head and saw you
Smiling brightly and next to you was
BTS
Suga
(Hi) Hi
BTS
Suga
How have you been? I’ve been ok
Suga
Unlike my heart that feels like it’ll explode
The temperature right now is -248
Jin
I’m only going around

Jin
I’m only going around
JHope
(Through the fog, I kept watching over you as you smiled
In the reality of my orbit that broke the rules
Without meaning, without you, without anything)
Jin
I’m just going in circles
JHope
(I’m just a number
And a dark Pluto that’s hard for you to remember
But still, I’ll be going around you, damn)
