Jungkook
Cause I’ll be in love maze
Cause I’ll be in love maze
Jimin
Trapped in a maze of decisions
Exhausted by all the different chaos
We’ve wandered around, looking for the answer
Lost in the maze, in the darkness
Jungkook
We ran and ran endlessly
But all the fake noise
Can tear us apart
It’s true baby
Jimin
We must believe only in ourselves
Jin
Can’t let go of each other’s hands
Jimin
We need to be together forever
RM
People say
That I’ll end up a fool
But I don’t wanna use my head
I don’t wanna calculate
Love ain’t a business
Rather like a fitness
I’ve never been in a calculating love
I know it’ll be cold like winter
But I still wanna try
If you push me, I’ll fall, just raise me up again
Even if I pull, you don’t have to come
Let them be them
Let us be us
Love is a maze damn
But you is amaze yeah
Jimin
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
Lie ay ay in this maze
My ay ay never lose me
In love maze
V
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
My ay ay come closer
My ay ay never go awry
In love maze
Jimin
No matter what others say, don’t listen
Just let’em talk, whatever they say
Jin
The more they do, the more I’m sure
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Jimin
Can’t you hear me, you have to trust me
Jin
Baby just don’t give a damn
Jimin
Promise, promise me
Suga
All around us is a maze, different paths
We’re walking in this abyss
There’s a thin light over there
I hope we’re going toward paradise
Know this, sometimes lies will try to tear us apart
Hardships will try to deceive us but
Just focus on me then
In the darkness, just the two of us is enough
In all these lies
If we’re together, even an endless maze is paradise
Jin
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
Lie ay ay in this maze
My ay ay never lose me
In love maze
JHope
What can we do? We did the official thing
So we need to follow the rules
Even in this wandering maze
Even on this mysterious path
We’re taking care of each other
I always think, even if eternity is hard
I wanna try it, let’s be forever
Our own mountain, our own climb
Our own world, our own heart
Travel toward the exit
Our held hands will be the map
Jungkook
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go

In love maze
V
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
My ay ay come closer
My ay ay never go awry
In love maze
