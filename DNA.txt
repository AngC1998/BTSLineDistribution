At first sight, I could recognize you
As if we were calling for each other
The DNA in my blood vessels tell me
That it’s you I was looking all over for

Our meeting is like a mathematical formula
Commandments of religion, providence of the universe;

You’re the source of my dream
Take it, take it
My hand reaching out to you is my chosen fate

Because we’re the two who found our destiny

Through the infinite centuries and beyond
In the previous life and maybe the next too
We’re eternally together

Because from the very beginning, my heart runs to you
