RM
You in danger
You in danger
You in danger
You in danger
You’re always like this
You are you, I am me, your formula
My phone is just a mere accessory
Am I really your boyfriend? I’m sick
Why do you push off expressing your feelings like homework?
Are we in a business relationship? Or do you not like me?
This magic spell
Please be kinder, I’ll recite it again today
Jungkook
We are like parallel lines
We look at the same place but are so different
I don’t have anyone but you
But why does it feel like I’m outside of you?
If I stay quiet, you ask, “Are you mad?”
Well, did you even do anything to make me mad?
RM
Jungkook
You’re a cutie and I am pitiful
I hope for a miracle of you loving me more than I love you
Jin
You don’t have me but I’m filled with you
It’s driving me crazy
Jimin
Why are you doing this? Why are you making me into a fool?
I’m warning you now, stop confusing me
Jungkook
Are you joking? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
Jimin
You’re in danger right now, why are you testing me?
Why are you testing me? Stop confusing me
V
Are you joking? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
Jimin
You’re in danger right now, why are you testing me?
Why are you testing me? Stop confusing me
V
It hurts so much because of you
It hurts so much because of you
It hurts so much because of you
Jimin
Stop confusing me
V
You’re so bad to me
You’re so bad to me
You’re so bad to me
Jimin
Stop confusing me
JHope
You’re not answering, I’m looking for how to unlock you
I’m investigating a girl like you and your true feelings
All you send me is a line or two through text
Is this the relationship and dream that I’ve wanted?
Where did my exciting love story go?
Move out of the way, drama characters
I rip out my hair hundreds of times because of you
But you don’t care, you think it’s fine and you kick me
Suga
What, what, what am I to you?
I hear about you from your friends rather than you
I want you, I want you, huh, I want you
A girl like you, a con-artist, a criminal who shook my heart
You used up my heart before the fire even started
I can try to have a one-sided relationship but it’ll be useless
Maybe you’re more comfortable with being friends
Instead of lovers, I’m a love loser
Jin
You don’t have me but I’m filled with you
It’s driving me crazy
Jimin
Why are you doing this? Why are you making me into a fool?
I’m warning you now, stop confusing me
Jungkook
Are you joking? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?

Are you joking? What am I to you?
Am I easy to you? Are you playing with me?
Jimin
You’re in danger right now, why are you testing me?
Why are you testing me? Stop confusing me
V
It hurts so much because of you
It hurts so much because of you
It hurts so much because of you
Jimin
Stop confusing me
V
You’re so bad to me
You’re so bad to me
You’re so bad to me
Jimin
Stop confusing me
