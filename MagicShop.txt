I know you’re hesitating
Because even if you tell the truth, it’ll come back as scars
Jungkook
I won’t say clichéd things like “have strength”
I’ll just listen to you, listen
RM
What did I tell you?
I told you you’d overcome
You didn’t believe (really)
Will we be able to overcome?
This miracle
Did we make it?
(No) I was always here
You came to me
I do believe your galaxy
I wanna hear your melody
The stars in your Milky Way
How will they appear in your sky?
At the end of my despair
I found you, don’t forget
You’re my last reason
Standing at the edge of a cliff
Live
Jin
Days when you hate that you’re you
Days when you wanna disappear
Let’s make a door in your heart
Jimin
If you open that door and go inside
This place will be waiting for you
It’s ok to believe, it’ll comfort you, this Magic Shop
Jungkook
As you drink a cup of warm tea
As you look above to the Milky Way
Jimin
You’ll be alright, oh this is a Magic Shop

JHope
Like a rose when blooming
Like a cherry blossom when scattering
Like a lily when withering
Like those beautiful moments
Suga
I always wanna be the best
So I was always impatient and anxious
Comparing myself became a daily thing
My greed that used to be a weapon
Became a prison and noose
But looking back, to be honest
I don’t think I wanted to be the best
JHope
I wanted to be someone’s comfort
I wanted to touch someone’s heart
I want to take away your sadness, your pain
Jungkook
Days when you hate that you’re you

So show me
(I’ll show you)
Show you show you

If I told you I used to be scared of everything too
Will you believe me?
All of the truth, all of the remaining time
Jimin
All of your answers are in this place that you found
In your Milky Way, in your heart
BTS
You gave me the best of me
So you’ll give you the best of you
You found me, you recognized me
You gave me the best of me
So you’ll give you the best of you
So I’ll find you, the galaxy that’s inside of you
