RM
Hey you, what’s your dream?
Hey you, what’s your dream?
Hey you, what’s your dream?
Is that all your dream is?
Suga
I wanna big house, big cars & big rings
But actually, I don’t have any big dreams
Haha, I live quite comfortably
Even if I don’t dream, no one says anything
RM
Everyone is thinking
the same way as me
I completely forgot about my childhood
when I had a lot of dreams
Don’t worry about college,
I’ll at least go to a school that’s far away
Jungkook
Ok mom, I’m going to the library right now
V
What is the you that you’ve dreamed of?
Who do you see in the mirror? I gotta say
JHope
Go on your path
Even if you live for a day
Do something
Put away your weakness
Jungkook
Why aren’t you saying anything?
You don’t wanna study
but you’re scared to quit school?
See, you’re already getting ready for school
Please grow up, you’re all talk dude,
you have a glass mentality, boy
(Stop) Ask yourself if you’ve ever
worked hard for anything
RM
Hey you, what’s your dream?
Hey you, what’s your dream?
Hey you, what’s your dream?
Is that all your dream is?
Jungkook
That’s a lie, you such a liar
See me, see me, ya you’re a hypocrite
Why’re you telling to go a different path? Take care of yourself
Please don’t force me
BTS
(Lalalalala)
Jimin
What’s your dream, what’s your dream?
BTS
(Lalalalala)
Jimin
Is that it? Is that it?
Suga
Sick of the same day, the repeating days
Grown-ups and my parents
keep instilling confined dreams to me
Number one future career is a government worker?
It’s not a forced dream, a ninth inning relief pitcher
JHope
Throw a fast ball at the waste of time that is night study sessions
Rebel against the hellish society,
dreams are a special pardon
Ask yourself about your dream profile
Become the main subject of your life
that has always been suppressed
Jin
What is the you that you’ve dreamed of?
Who do you see in the mirror? I gotta say
Jimin
Go on your path
Even if you live for a day
Do something
Put away your weakness
RM
Hey you, what’s your dream?
Hey you, what’s your dream?
Hey you, what’s your dream?

Jungkook
That’s a lie, you such a liar
See me, see me, ya you’re a hypocrite
Why’re you telling to go a different path? Take care of yourself
Please don’t force me
BTS
(Lalalalala)
Jimin
What’s your dream, what’s your dream?
BTS
(Lalalalala)
Jimin
Is that it? Is that it?
RM
Don’t know how to live
Suga
Don’t know how to fly
Jungkook
Don’t know how to decide
RM
Don’t know how to dream now
RM
Open your eyes now
Dance a dance now
Dream a dream now
Stop hesitating, stop being indecisive, wussup!
Jungkook
That’s a lie, you such a liar
See me, see me, ya you’re a hypocrite
Jungkook
Jimin

Is that it? Is that it?
RM
To all the youngsters without dreams.
