Jungkook
Somebody call me right one
Somebody call me wrong
I don’t wanna care
How about you?
So what
Let go
JHope
So many worries behind that sigh
Stop worrying, you already know
Whenever you wanna give up in the middle of this road
Shout out even louder
So what what what
Suga
Nothing goes the way I plan
There’s no where to hide
The dice has already been thrown a long time ago
If you hesitate, you might get swept away, oh bae
All your worries
Are just part of the swamp of your imagination that you created
Instead of worrying, go, go, don’t be timid, cheer up
Shout out, so what what
Jimin
We are we are we are
Young & wild & free
Jungkook
Worries that have no answers
Don’t fall into them
Jimin
Even if it’s dangerous on the border
Let’s just laugh and chat and split through the wind
Jungkook
Sometimes, we can be foolish and just run
Even with mistakes and tears, we just go
Jungkook
So what
Don’t stop to worry
It’s pointless
Jin
Let go
Though there isn’t an answer yet
You can start the fight
Jungkook
So what

So what
JHope
Ay some people hate work
Ay some people only wanna rest
Ay their pain and exhaustion
Ay when they all come to me
Ay what can you do?
There’s only one answer
Just trust and run
So what?
RM
I don’t wanna die right now
I don’t wanna I don’t wanna fight right now
I don’t wanna worry, life is long
Just go, I wanna live right now
The brakes are broken so just step on the gas pedal
People’s situations are all different
What’s the fun if you know it all?
Pain is my teacher
So, so what?
