V
Full of loneliness
This garden is bloomed
Full of thorns
I bind myself in this sand castle
Jungkook
What is your name
Do you have a place to go
Oh could you tell me?
I saw you hidden in this garden
Jin
And I know
All of your warmth is true
I want to hold
Your hand picking the blue flower
Jimin
It’s my fate
Don’t smile on me
Light on me
Because I can’t come to you
There’s no name you can call me
Jungkook
You know that I can’t
Show you ME
Give you ME
I can’t show you a run-down part of myself
I wear a mask again and go to see you
But I still want you
Jin
Bloomed in a garden of loneliness
A flower that resembles you
I wanted to give it to you
After I take off this foolish mask
Jimin
But I know
I can never do that
I must hide
Because I am ugly
V
I am afraid
I am run-down
I’m so afraid
That you will leave me again in the end
I wear a mask again and go to see you
Jungkook
What I can do is
In the garden
In this world
I bloom a pretty flower that looks like you
And breathe as the me that you know
But I still want you
I still want you
Jin
Maybe back then
A little
Just this much
If I got the courage to stand before you
Would everything be different now
Jimin
I am crying at this
Disappeared
Fallen
Sand castle that’s left alone
Looking at the broken mask
And I still want you
Jungkook
But I still want you
But I still want you
Jimin
And I still want you
