Yeah, who says my spoon is dirty?
I don’t care, when I grab the mic, I have several gold spoons
Several uncooked steaks over there make me mad
Once again, I’ll chew you all up, on the night of the stars

You thought I was gonna fail but I’m fine, sorry
Sorry, Billboard
Sorry, worldwide
Sorry mom, your son’s too hot
I’m being a good son in place of you
No cons in our concerts

If you’re jealous, sue me

Total exhaustion on the stage
