Goodbyes open up to me
Without knowing, blood comes into my eyes
Things I can’t say flow through
Lingering feelings crawl on top of my face
At one point, you were my dear
But now, it’s just bitter, this beer
My heart is stained with self-hate that’s too late
It gets cut even by the passing wind
This goodbye came to me at the end of my play
That was only filled with lies
That’s the price I’ll pay
If someone could turn time back
Maybe I could’ve become more honest
With my bare face that only I know of
With my long-time friends inside that are ugly and miserable
Would you have still put on that smile
And loved me like that?
Stop talking about forever
There’s always an end to everything
If there’s a start
I don’t wanna listen to that
Things that are too right or too much comfort
I don’t wanna listen to that
I was just so scared
Because it felt like maybe
I never really loved you
It’s too late but you were true
Only you loved me

You’re my tear
JHope
We walked in the same direction
But this place is our last
We used to talk about forever
But we’re breaking each other down
Suga
I thought we had the same dream
But that dream became just a dream
My heart is ripping, just set it on fire
So the pain and the feelings won’t remain

Suga
Goodbyes are T.E.A.R
Tears are an extravagance to me
There’s no such thing as beautiful goodbyes
So just begin now
Woo take it easy, slowly cut out my heart
Step on the pieces that were broken apart
So no other feelings will remain
My heart’s shredded into pieces, just set it on fire
Yes, right there, don’t hesitate
This is the ending that you wanted
So kill me without hesitation
Woo yeah yeah burn it
Woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
Woo yeah yeah yeah burn it
So not even the ashes remain
Suga
This is the real you and this is the real me
We saw the end, there’s no more resentment
The sweet dream has broken, I closed my eyes
This is the real you and this is the real me

You’re my
Suga
What can I say?
We already know
The answer is here
But it’s so hard
JHope
Why are tears falling
Why is my heart ripping?
It’s no use to me
Goodbyes are just momentary (flashback)
The moment you said it
The moment our start has become irregular
The moment everything became dangerous
Those two words became our end
I shouldn’t have cried, shouldn’t have been torn apart
I couldn’t say any of that
But from now on, I have an incurable disease
You’re my start and my end, that is all
My new encounter and my goodbye
You were my everything, keep going forward fear
It’ll keep repeating, through you
