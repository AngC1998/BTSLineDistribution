Jungkook
A strange little boy
He sang like he breathed
It didn’t matter where
He just wanted to do music
Only singing
Was the thing that made his heart race
He only walked
On one path but
Jimin
It’s not easy
Failures and despair
But on a tired day, someone said
V
You’re a singing star
You’re a singing star
But I see no star
After a few years passed
Jin
RM
(We still) Sky high, sky fly, sky dope
(We still) Same try, same scar, same work
(We still) Wherever we go in the world
(We still) We’re working in our hotel rooms
(I still) Some days, it’s so good, some days, not so good
(I still) Who should I live as today, Kim Namjoon or RM?
RM
25, I still don’t know how to live well
So today, let’s just go
Jimin
We goin’ from NY to Cali
London to Paris
Wherever we go, that place is party

Jungkook
We goin’ from Tokyo, Italy
Hong Kong to Brazil
Wherever in the world, I will sing

JHope
Walking on clouds every day
I’m feeling it on the clouds, check it on the clouds
A cloudy chemistry, all day with the clouds
Having fun riding clouds, looking at clouds and fade in
You guys don’t know, maybe
Been riding airplanes for the past few years
Mileage is way over tens of thousands
It’s time to go to you and comfort you
I’ll give it to you with those mileage points
Love, airplane mode, take your mind off of everything
Whoever it is, whatever they say
Just keep protecting what’s first
Look at the night sky, I’m adjusting my seat
Jimin
I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know
Suga
How to stop
Jimin
I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know
Suga
How to rest
Jimin
I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know
Suga
How to fail
Jimin
I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know
Suga
Fed up with people
Showing off their money on TV
My passport is about to die from overworking
You guys are the ones who got the media advantage hahaha
You’re the ones who are better at playing the celebrity
We’re still the same as before
Woo!
