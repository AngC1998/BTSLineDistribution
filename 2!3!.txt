Been trying to tell you this
I was supposed to tell you this
This is all for you
Let’s only walk on flower paths
I can’t say that
Let’s only see good things
I can’t say that
Only good things will happen now
It won’t hurt anymore
I can’t say those things
I can’t say those lies
Suga
You’re idols so I don’t have to listen to you to know you suck
I don’t like your lyrics, it’s obvious
You have no power
So you probably did something fishy
Seeing what you’ve done, I know you’re gonna fail
(Thank you so much) because of your own inferiority complex
You proved that you’re worse
Than you were in high school
Clap clap, keep it up
We’re gonna be happy on our own, good yeah I’m good
Jungkook
It’s alright, now count 1, 2, 3 and forget
Erase all sad memories
Hold my hand and smile
Jimin
It’s alright, now count 1, 2, 3 and forget
Erase all sad memories
Hold each others hands and smile

Still, I hope there will be good days
If you believe me, 1, 2, 3

Still, I hope there are way more good days
If you believe me, 1, 2, 3

Then everything will change
Jimin
For better days
Because we’re together
JHope
Behind the stage, I’m in the shadow, I’m in the darkness
I didn’t want to show you my pain
But I still lack so much
I only wanted to make you smile
I wanted to be good
JHope
(So thanks) for believing in me
For handling these tears and scars
(So thanks) for being my light
For being a flower in the most beautiful moment of life
