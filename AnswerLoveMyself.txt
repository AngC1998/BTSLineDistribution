Jimin
Open your eyes in the dark
When your heart beats
Jungkook
Face to face, you in the mirror
There's an old, frightened question
Suga
Maybe it's better than loving someone
What's more difficult is that I love myself
Let's face it
The standards you've given me are more strict with you
A thick ring in your life
Because he is also part of you
Now I have to forgive myself
Our lives are long. Trust me in this maze
After winter, spring comes again
Jungkook
A cold stare
Hide me
It was a complete reversal
Jimin
I fell down to get that many stars
I'm the one who targets those thousands of brilliant arrows
Jin
Jimin
You've show me I have reasons
I should love myself
Give me my breath
V
The me of yesterday, the me of today, the me of tomorrow
Jungkook
(I'm learning now to love myself)
V
Every last one of them
RM
Maybe there's no answer
Maybe this isn't the answer either
You know, even if you love me
I needed someone's permission
I'm still looking for my won
But I don't want to die anymore
The sad me
The sick me
The more beautiful
JHope
Yeah, that beauty
I know
The way to my love
The most necessary thing
What you're doing right now
Actions for me
An attitude toward me
It's the happiness for me
I'll show you what I've got
I'm not afraid. It's my thing
Love myself
Jin
From the beginning
To the end
There's only one answer
Jimin
Why don't you keep trying to hide it?
Every scar I made was my zodiac sign
V
Jungkook
You've show me I have reasons
I should love myself
Give me my breath
Jungkook
Still in me
Jimin
I'm clumsy, but...
Jin
Jimin
You've show me I have reasons
I should love myself
Give me my breath
V
The me of yesterday, the me of today, the me of tomorrow
Jungkook
(I'm learning now to love myself)
V
Every last one of them
